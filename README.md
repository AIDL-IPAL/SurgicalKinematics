# Surgical Reconstruction Research Pipeline

This site presents computational methods for reconstructing surgical scenes and instrument kinematics from imaging and video. It highlights algorithm development (learning-based pose & kinematics models, including depth reconstruction & spatial registration), datasets and evaluation protocols, demos of current results, and our open-source codebase.

## GitHub Workspace

Project code, data, issues, and CI are available in the GitHub workspace (coming soon): [Surgical Instrument Kinematics Reconstruction](https://github.com/example-org/surgical-kinematics-workspace)
